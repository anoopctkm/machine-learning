## Data

Data is large and inconvenient to ship directly with this project. The two datasets being used can be obtained by downloading them from Kaggle. The respective websites for each dataset also provide an explanation and examples of the data included.

- [MovieLens 20M](https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset)
- [IMDB 5000 Movie](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

## Reproducing results

There are three pieces needed to reproduce the work done here:

- IPython notebook in the root directory: `notebook.ipynb`
	- This notebook runs everything, and lists all required python libraries at the top.
- Python scripts contained in the directory, `scripts/`
	- These scripts are referenced in `notebook.ipynb`
- The data files described above, contained in a directory, `data/`
